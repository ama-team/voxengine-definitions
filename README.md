# VoxEngine Definitions

This project simply repeats VoxEngine definitions using JSDoc with sole 
purpose of providing autocompletion for end developer.

Simply put, all you need is JSDoc-compatible IDE and 
`npm install @ama-team/voxengine-definitions --save-dev` to develop your 
VoxImplant scripts and get fancy autocomplete.
